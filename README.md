Tools: Excel, Python (for cleaning), [optionally add: Power BI/Tableau if used]

Project Overview
This project analyzes a simulated digital advertising campaign dataset (33,821 daily records, 2023–2025) to uncover trends, ROI drivers, and actionable recommendations for campaign optimization.

Data Cleaning
Standardized date formats, removed non-date values

Mapped country codes to full names

Unified currencies and converted all spend/revenue to USD

Handled missing values and inconsistent formats in all key columns

Created an Issues Log to document all data quality fixes

Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics: Spend, revenue, impressions, and clicks summarized for the full dataset.

Distribution analysis: Most campaigns are low-budget; revenue is concentrated in a handful of campaigns/days.

Segmentation:

By region—spend/revenue mostly from 5 markets

By platform—Instagram and Twitter most efficient by ROAS

By campaign/channel/status—Top 10 campaigns drive outsized impact, with room for budget reallocation.

Time trends: Spend, revenue, and engagement are stable, suggesting reliable delivery and no major “crashes” or booms.

Efficiency metrics:

ROAS, CTR, CPC calculated and visualized for both region and platform

Clear differences in efficiency across both dimensions

Key Insights
Spend and revenue are concentrated in a few large markets and campaigns.

Instagram delivers the highest ROAS by platform; Australia and Singapore by region.

Campaign delivery and engagement are consistent, but optimization potential exists in lower-performing or paused campaigns.

Recommendations
Shift budget toward high-ROAS markets and platforms.

Monitor and diagnose low-performing campaigns/days.

Test budget increases in top-performing segments.

Reevaluate paused/ended campaigns for reactivation or learnings.

Continue tracking ROI, CPC, and CTR over time to adapt to changing market dynamics.
